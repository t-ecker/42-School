## How the 42 Program Works

The **42** program is divided into two phases: the **Core Curriculum** and the **Mastery** phase.

### The Core Curriculum

The **Core Curriculum** provides foundational skills in programming, aiming to build a strong technical base. It consists of three parts: the first two focus on **C programming** and **Shell Scripts**, covering low-level programming, memory management, and algorithms. In the third part, students shift to **C++** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, along with complementary technologies like **front-end** and **back-end** development and **containerization**.

>These parts are represented by the **core circles** in the diagram below, where each dot symbolizes a project
### Mastery

The **Mastery** phase allows students to specialize in areas like **Web Development**, **AI**, **Security**, **Data Science** and more, honing their skills based on personal interests and career goals. 
> The **Mastery** phase is symbolizes as the **outer parts** of the diagram.

## My Journey at 42 Heilbronn

I began my path at **42 Heilbronn** right after finishing my Abitur, starting with the **Piscine** in **January 2023**—an intensive one-month C bootcamp that serves as the entry point to the program. After being accepted, I officially started the **Core Curriculum** in **March 2023**, which I completed in **XXX 2024**.

To gain some real-world experience, I did the **6-month internship** at XXX right after the core. Since **October 2024**, I’ve been continuing with the **Mastery** phase, alongside my university studies.
